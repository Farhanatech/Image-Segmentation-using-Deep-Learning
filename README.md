# Image-Segmentation-using-Deep-Learning
This project utilizes a Keras U-Net for semantic segmentation of aerial imagery, focusing on cloud region identification. It includes data preprocessing, augmentation, and training with combined categorical crossentropy and Dice loss, evaluated using mIoU and Dice Coefficient. The model is exported for remote sensing applications.
